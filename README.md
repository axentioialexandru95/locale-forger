Great! I’ll put together a detailed architecture and implementation plan for a highly scalable, self-hosted, single-tenant translation management platform using Laravel 12 and Filament v3. The plan will support organization-wide settings (like DeepL API keys), use queues for background jobs, and be optimized to handle a large number of translation keys—comparable to services like Localise.biz.

I'll let you know once it's ready.

# **Self-Hosted Translation Management System Architecture (Laravel 12 + Filament v3)**

## **1. System Overview and Goals**

This self-hosted, single-tenant Translation Management System (TMS) is designed to manage translations at scale – on par with platforms like Localise.biz (Loco) – using a Laravel 12 backend and a Filament v3 admin UI. The system will support organization-wide settings (e.g. storing a DeepL API key for machine translation), multiple projects, and multiple languages per project. Key features include a polished admin interface for managing translation keys (“assets” in Loco terminology ([Blog Eleven Labs - Managing translations with localise.biz](https://blog.eleven-labs.com/en/manage-translations-with-localise-biz/#:~:text=Implementation%20of%20a%20translation%20workflow))) and their translations, robust import/export in JSON, CSV, and Excel formats, a RESTful API (protected by Laravel Sanctum) for integration and CLI usage, and background processing via Laravel Queues for heavy tasks (like bulk translation with DeepL or large file imports/exports). The overarching goals are **scalability**, **clean architecture**, and **high performance** – ensuring the app can handle potentially millions of translation entries while keeping response times fast and maintenance manageable.

## **2. High-Level Architecture**

**Monolithic Laravel Application:** The system will be a Laravel 12 application following MVC principles and leveraging Laravel’s service container and queue system. It will serve both a web-based admin UI (for human translators and managers via Filament) and APIs (for programmatic access via CLI or other clients). All components (UI, API, background workers) run within the same codebase and share the same single-tenant database (for one organization’s data). This simplifies deployment (one application to host per organization) while still logically separating concerns within the code.

**Component Breakdown:** The architecture consists of several key components:

-   **Filament v3 Admin Panel:** Provides a rich UI for managing projects, keys, translations, users, and settings. It is built on the TALL stack (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire) ([Filament - Accelerated Laravel development framework: admin panel, form builder, table builder and more](https://filamentphp.com/#:~:text=T%20ailwind%20CSS%20%20,aravel%20%20%20L%20ivewire)), enabling dynamic, responsive admin pages with minimal custom JS. Filament will be configured as an admin panel (e.g. accessible at `/admin`) where authenticated users can perform all translation management tasks.
-   **RESTful API:** A set of JSON-based API endpoints (under `/api`, e.g. `/api/projects`, `/api/keys`, etc.) allows external tools or a CLI (command-line interface) to interact with the system. This API is protected by Sanctum personal access tokens for authentication. Each API request uses token-based auth (Bearer tokens) and Sanctum will validate the token via the `auth:sanctum` guard ([Laravel Sanctum - Laravel 12.x - The PHP Framework For Web Artisans](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/sanctum#:~:text=Issuing%20API%20Tokens)). The API exposes similar functionality as the UI (retrieving and updating translations, listing projects, etc.), enabling automation and integration into development workflows.
-   **Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL):** The system’s single-tenant database stores all persistent data: organizations, users, projects, languages, translation keys, and translation texts. The schema is designed for **high performance** with proper normalization and indexes to handle a very large number of translation records. (See **Data Model** section for details.)
-   **Background Job Queue:** Laravel’s queue system (with a Redis or database queue backend) is used to offload time-consuming tasks from web requests. Jobs such as importing a large file, exporting all translations, or auto-translating hundreds of keys via DeepL will be dispatched to the queue. This keeps the UI/API responsive by handling these tasks asynchronously ([Techniques for Scaling Laravel Applications for High Traffic | by Kamruzzaman Kamrul | Medium](https://medium.com/@kamruljpi/techniques-for-scaling-laravel-applications-for-high-traffic-d1b2394fb865#:~:text=Scaling%20a%20Laravel%20application%20to,you%20scale%20your%20Laravel%20application)) ([Techniques for Scaling Laravel Applications for High Traffic | by Kamruzzaman Kamrul | Medium](https://medium.com/@kamruljpi/techniques-for-scaling-laravel-applications-for-high-traffic-d1b2394fb865#:~:text=3)). A supervisor or Laravel Horizon can be used to run and monitor queue workers in the background.
-   **External Integration (DeepL API):** The system integrates with DeepL’s translation API for machine translations. This is done through a dedicated service class that calls DeepL’s HTTP endpoints (using Laravel’s HTTP client or an official SDK). These calls are typically made within queued jobs (to avoid slowing down user interactions) and must respect DeepL’s rate limits and quotas (e.g. 500,000 chars/month on the free tier ([DeepL API Free vs. DeepL API Pro - DeepL Help Center](https://support.deepl.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021183620-DeepL-API-Free-vs-DeepL-API-Pro#:~:text=DeepL%20API%20Free%20vs,plan%20offers%20the%20following))). The DeepL API key is stored in the organization settings and used when auto-translating content.

**Request Flow:** For interactive users, the typical flow is: User makes a request (via the Filament UI or API) → Laravel controller (or Filament resource controller) handles it → business logic (services, models) executes, possibly dispatching a background job for heavy work → returns a response. If a background job is dispatched, the UI will give feedback (e.g. a notification that a job is in progress) and results will appear once the job completes. For CLI/API usage, a script (using the personal access token) calls the REST API (for example, to fetch the latest translations or push new keys); the API controller authenticates via Sanctum and then processes the request similar to the web flow.

## **3. Data Model and Database Schema**

To efficiently manage translations at scale, the database uses a normalized schema with separate tables for core entities and careful indexing. The main entities are **Organization**, **Project**, **Language**, **TranslationKey**, **Translation**, **User**, and pivot tables for many-to-many relations as needed. Below is a breakdown of the schema:

-   **Organization:** Represents the owning entity of the system (since single-tenant, this may be just one record, but designing the schema with an org table allows future extension to multi-org if needed). Fields: `id` (PK), `name`, and organization-wide settings like `deepl_api_key` (stored securely, e.g. encrypted). Relationship: One Organization has many Projects, and many Users.
-   **Project:** Represents a translation project (e.g. a specific application or module being translated). Fields: `id` (PK), `org_id` (FK to Organization), `name` (project name), `slug` or code, `primary_language_id` (FK to Language – the default or source language for this project). Relationships: Project belongs to Organization; Project has many TranslationKeys; Project has many Languages (many-to-many via an association table or inferred via translations). We will likely have an explicit **ProjectLanguages** table `(project_id, language_id)` to list which locales are active for a project. This makes it easy to, for example, display all languages of a project and implement fallback chains. Each project can specify a default fallback language (often the primary/source language).
-   **Language:** A master list of supported languages/locales. Fields: `id` (PK), `code` (locale code like “en”, “fr-FR”), `name` (e.g. “English”, “Français”). This table is relatively small and static. Relationships: Languages have many Translation records (one per key per language), and many Projects via ProjectLanguages.
-   **TranslationKey:** Represents a translatable key/asset (the string identifier). Fields: `id` (PK), `project_id` (FK to Project), `key` (unique identifier within the project, e.g. `"homepage.welcome_message"`), `description` (optional context for translators). We separate the key from its translations for normalization and scalability – this way, we don’t duplicate key names for each language. Relationship: A TranslationKey belongs to one Project and has many Translation entries (one per language). Projects can have thousands of keys, so an index on `(project_id, key)` will be created for fast lookup by key name.
-   **Translation:** Stores the actual translated text for a given key in a given language. Fields: `id` (PK) – or we could use a composite key `(key_id, language_id)`, `key_id` (FK to TranslationKey), `language_id` (FK to Language), `text` (the translated string, possibly a TEXT column), and metadata like `is_machine_translated` (boolean flag if populated via DeepL), `status` (e.g. “provisional” or “final” if implementing a review workflow similar to Loco ([Blog Eleven Labs - Managing translations with localise.biz](https://blog.eleven-labs.com/en/manage-translations-with-localise-biz/#:~:text=Implementation%20of%20a%20translation%20workflow))), `updated_by` (user who last modified, for audit). Relationship: Translation belongs to a TranslationKey and to a Language. We will enforce a unique index on `(key_id, language_id)` to prevent duplicate entries. This **separate translations table** approach is a common, normalized design for multi-language content: “a subordinate table with translations must have the same key fields as the mother table, plus a field indicating the translation language” ([ Best Practices for Multi-Language Database Design | Vertabelo Database Modeler ](https://vertabelo.com/blog/multi-language-database-design/#:~:text=One%20way%20to%20store%20the,field%20indicating%20the%20translation%20language)). It allows adding new languages without altering the schema and avoids data duplication.
-   **User:** Represents a system user (e.g. translators, project managers, admins). Fields: `id` (PK), `org_id` (FK to Organization), `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, etc., and possibly a `role` (enum or role ID) to distinguish admins vs translators. Relationship: User belongs to Organization; if we implement per-project permissions, we could have a pivot table linking users to projects with roles (for example, a user could be assigned as a translator on specific projects). For simplicity, global roles can be used (with admins having access to all projects and translators restricted to certain projects via policy checks).

**Entity Relationships and Performance Considerations:** This schema is optimized for quick lookups and maintenance: for example, retrieving all translations for a project involves joining keys with translations filtered by project. With proper indexes on foreign keys (e.g. index `translation.key_id`, `translation.language_id`, and `translation_key.project_id`), these queries will scale to large datasets. Indexing frequently queried columns is vital for performance ([Techniques for Scaling Laravel Applications for High Traffic | by Kamruzzaman Kamrul | Medium](https://medium.com/@kamruljpi/techniques-for-scaling-laravel-applications-for-high-traffic-d1b2394fb865#:~:text=a)). We will add composite indexes where appropriate, such as an index on `TranslationKey(project_id, key)` for fast retrieval by key, and on `Translation(key_id, language_id)` for fetching a specific translation.

_(A conceptual Entity-Relationship Diagram would show: Organization –< Project –< TranslationKey –< Translation >– Language, and Organization –< User. Each “–<” denotes a one-to-many relationship.)_

**Fallback Language Logic:** The schema supports fallback languages by linking each Project to a primary language, or by a mapping in the ProjectLanguages pivot. In practice, when exporting or retrieving translations, if a given translation is missing (the `text` is NULL or no row exists for that key-language), the system will substitute text from the fallback language. We can implement this either in application logic or via a database view/query. For example, at export time, for each target language we check if a translation exists; if not, we lookup the fallback language’s text ([What is fallback language? | Lingohub Help Center](https://help.lingohub.com/en/articles/6686669-what-is-fallback-language#:~:text=fallback%20language%20is%20a%20language,settings%20for%20target%20languages%20only)) ([What is fallback language? | Lingohub Help Center](https://help.lingohub.com/en/articles/6686669-what-is-fallback-language#:~:text=Upon%20exporting%2C%20Lingohub%20will%20automatically,empty%20and%20export%20the%20following)). Lingohub’s approach is to recursively fall back until a non-empty translation is found (ultimately falling back to the source language) ([What is fallback language? | Lingohub Help Center](https://help.lingohub.com/en/articles/6686669-what-is-fallback-language#:~:text=de)). Our design will allow each project to define one fallback (usually the source language of that project). If needed, a chain of fallbacks can be configured (e.g. de-AT falls back to de-DE, which falls back to en-GB) – this could be represented by a self-referencing “fallback_language_id” in the ProjectLanguages or an ordered list. Initially, we will implement a single-level fallback (project default) for simplicity: **no translation will remain empty on export** – missing entries are filled by the fallback language’s text ([What is fallback language? | Lingohub Help Center](https://help.lingohub.com/en/articles/6686669-what-is-fallback-language#:~:text=fallback%20language%20is%20a%20language,settings%20for%20target%20languages%20only)).

## **4. Backend Design and Laravel Best Practices**

The backend logic is organized to be **clean, modular, and maintainable**, following Laravel conventions and best practices:

-   **Eloquent Models & Relationships:** Each main table has an Eloquent model (e.g. `Organization`, `Project`, `Language`, `TranslationKey`, `Translation`, `User`). We leverage Eloquent relationships to simplify data access. For example, `Project` model will have `hasMany TranslationKey` and `hasMany Language (through ProjectLanguage)`. `TranslationKey` will have `hasMany Translation` and belong to `Project`. These relationships allow us to eager-load related data to avoid the N+1 query problem ([Techniques for Scaling Laravel Applications for High Traffic | by Kamruzzaman Kamrul | Medium](https://medium.com/@kamruljpi/techniques-for-scaling-laravel-applications-for-high-traffic-d1b2394fb865#:~:text=b)). For instance, when listing translation keys with their texts, we can query `TranslationKey::with(['translations', 'project'])` to fetch all needed data in a few queries. Eloquent’s expressive relationships also make code more readable.

-   **Repository & Service Layers:** To keep the codebase modular and facilitate future changes (or even swapping out storage if needed), we use a Repository-Service pattern for complex domains. The idea is to decouple business logic from controllers and from direct Eloquent calls. For each aggregate (e.g. translations), we create a **Repository** class responsible for data access (queries on Translation and TranslationKey models). We also create **Service** classes to encapsulate business operations (like “create a new project with default languages”, “import a file of translations”, or “trigger DeepL translation for a set of keys”). For example, a `TranslationRepository` might have methods like `findByKey($projectId, $key)` or `getMissingTranslations($project, $language)`, and a `TranslationService` would orchestrate higher-level operations using repositories and other services. This approach leads to thin controllers – controllers simply inject the needed service and call a method, rather than containing heavy logic. As a result, _“the `UserController` (for example) is clean, focused, and to the point, with complex logic tucked away in the service and repository”_ ([Mastering the Service-Repository Pattern in Laravel | by Binu Mathew | Medium](https://medium.com/@binumathew1988/mastering-the-service-repository-pattern-in-laravel-751da2bd3c86#:~:text=Look%20at%20that%20,in%20the%20service%20and%20repository)). We will define interfaces for repositories (e.g. `TranslationRepositoryInterface`), binding them in Laravel’s service container to concrete classes, so that the implementation can be swapped or mocked easily (this is useful for testing or if we later move to a different storage backend) ([Mastering the Service-Repository Pattern in Laravel | by Binu Mathew | Medium](https://medium.com/@binumathew1988/mastering-the-service-repository-pattern-in-laravel-751da2bd3c86#:~:text=1,etc.%20Consistency%20is%20key)). This layering also aligns with Domain-Driven Design principles, keeping domain logic (translation management) separate from frameworks and UI, and improves maintainability in the long run ([Mastering the Service-Repository Pattern in Laravel | by Binu Mathew | Medium](https://medium.com/@binumathew1988/mastering-the-service-repository-pattern-in-laravel-751da2bd3c86#:~:text=The%20Service)).

-   **Service Container & Dependency Injection:** All services and repositories are registered in Laravel’s service container. Controllers or other services obtain their dependencies via constructor injection. Laravel automatically resolves the correct implementation (e.g. `ProjectService` might depend on a `DeepLTranslator` service and a `TranslationRepository`; these are type-hinted in its constructor and the container injects the bound instances). Using the service container promotes loose coupling and easier testing. For instance, we can swap out the DeepL integration with a stub in tests by binding a different implementation for the interface.

-   **Form Requests & Validation:** We will use Laravel’s Form Request classes to handle input validation for both UI forms and API requests. This ensures data integrity (e.g. required fields, valid formats for locale codes, etc.) and keeps controllers slim. For example, creating a new Key will go through a validation ensuring the key is unique in that project and the input strings are well-formed.

-   **API Resources (Transformers):** To present data consistently in the API, we use Laravel’s **API Resource** classes. These allow us to transform Eloquent models into JSON structures with the desired fields. For example, a `ProjectResource` can output the project’s name, and an array of languages or a link to fetch languages; a `TranslationKeyResource` can include the key string and maybe a map of language => translation text. This abstraction makes it easy to change response formats as needed without altering underlying logic. It also can help with performance by controlling loaded relations. The Resources will be used by API controllers to format responses, ensuring the API returns clean JSON without exposing internal implementation details unintentionally.

-   **Policies & Authorization:** We will use Laravel’s authorization system (Policies or Gates) to enforce access control. Since it’s single-tenant, this is mainly to differentiate roles (e.g. only Admin users can create projects or manage other users, while translators might only edit translation texts). A Policy on Translation or Project can ensure that a translator user can only modify translations (not keys or settings), whereas an Admin can do everything. Sanctum’s personal access tokens can also be given abilities (scopes) – for instance, we might issue a “read-only” token vs a “write” token. This is optional, but Sanctum does support assigning abilities to tokens that our code can check ([Laravel Sanctum - GitHub Pages](https://devdocs-fr.github.io/laravel/7.x/sanctum.html#:~:text=Sanctum%20allows%20you%20to%20issue,using%20API%20tokens%2C%20the)).

-   **Caching Layer:** To optimize performance, we employ caching at multiple levels where appropriate. Laravel’s cache can store frequently accessed data in memory (e.g. using Redis or Memcached) ([Techniques for Scaling Laravel Applications for High Traffic | by Kamruzzaman Kamrul | Medium](https://medium.com/@kamruljpi/techniques-for-scaling-laravel-applications-for-high-traffic-d1b2394fb865#:~:text=)). Some examples:

    -   **Translations Cache:** For delivering translations to an app, instead of querying the database every time, the system could cache the entire set of translations for a project (or per language) as JSON. For instance, after an export or when an API call requests all translations, we cache that output. Future requests (or repeated CLI fetches) can then serve from cache until invalidated by new changes. This is similar to how some translation packages use DB + cache for quick reads ([Filament Translations - Filament Translation Manager - Made with Laravel](https://madewithlaravel.com/filament-translations#:~:text=Filament%20Translation%20Manager)). We must ensure to bust the cache on updates (e.g. flush or regenerate cache when a translation is updated or a new key is added).
    -   **Query Caching:** Use `Cache::remember` for expensive queries if real-time freshness is not critical. For example, the list of languages rarely changes, so caching it is safe.
    -   **Configuration Cache:** Since we have org-specific config like DeepL keys and maybe feature flags, we will utilize Laravel’s config repository or a settings table. We can cache these settings using Laravel’s config cache or a custom cache to avoid frequent DB lookups on each translation operation.
    -   We should also enable Laravel’s built-in caches: route caching (for API routes), view caching (for Blade views, though Filament uses Livewire components mainly), and op-code caching on the server.

-   **Logging & Monitoring:** All key actions (especially background jobs and external API calls) will be logged. Laravel’s logging, combined with tools like Telescope (for debugging) or Horizon (for queue monitoring) can be used in development and production. Horizon can be particularly useful to monitor queue throughput and failures in real-time for our translation jobs.

By adhering to these backend best practices, the system will be **modular, testable, and scalable**. The repository-service pattern ensures that as the application grows in complexity (e.g. adding versioning of translations or more integrations) we can maintain a clear structure. Thin controllers and well-defined domain services reflect a **clean architecture** approach, where use-cases (like “TranslateMissingKeysViaDeepL”) are implemented in one place and can be triggered by UI or API or even scheduled tasks consistently ([Clean Architecture with Laravel - DEV Community](https://dev.to/bdelespierre/how-to-implement-clean-architecture-with-laravel-2f2i#:~:text=So%20today%2C%20I%27m%20going%20to,Martin)) ([Clean Architecture with Laravel - DEV Community](https://dev.to/bdelespierre/how-to-implement-clean-architecture-with-laravel-2f2i#:~:text=So%2C%20how%20are%20we%20supposed,implement%20those%20use%20cases%20then)).

## **5. Filament v3 Admin Interface**

The admin UI is built with **Filament v3**, which provides a fast way to scaffold resource management pages with excellent UX out of the box. The panel will be configured for our single-tenant application (Filament v3 even supports multi-panel and multi-tenancy setups ([Filament - Accelerated Laravel development framework: admin panel, form builder, table builder and more](https://filamentphp.com/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Multiple%20panels)), but in our case a single admin panel is sufficient). Key points of the UI implementation:

-   **Resource Organization:** We will create Filament _Resources_ for each major model:

    -   **ProjectResource:** Allows listing projects, creating new ones, and managing project settings (like selecting supported languages and fallback language). The form for a project will include a multi-select field for languages (populating the ProjectLanguages pivot) and a dropdown for primary/fallback language.
    -   **LanguageResource:** (Optional to expose – languages might be mostly static/global. We might allow the org admin to add a custom locale if needed.) This would list available languages.
    -   **TranslationKeyResource:** This is central – it will list all translation keys (assets) in the system or filtered by project. We can utilize Filament’s table filters to filter keys by project, by translation status (e.g. show keys missing a translation in a selected language), or by tags if implemented. Each row will show the key name and perhaps an excerpt of translations. We can enable inline editing or actions to quickly navigate to translating that key.
    -   **Translation (as part of Key):** We might not have a separate resource just for translations; instead, when viewing or editing a TranslationKey, we display a sub-form or repeater of translations in different languages. Filament forms allow custom fields: we can create a custom form component that shows a set of text inputs – one for each language in the project – binding to a temporary data structure. On save, the Resource controller will update each Translation model accordingly. This provides a convenient UI to translate a key into multiple languages on one screen (similar to Loco’s web UI which shows a grid of languages for each asset).
    -   **UserResource:** To manage user accounts (invite new users, assign roles). Admin-only.
    -   **Settings pages:** Filament allows custom pages – we will add an Organization Settings page where the admin can input the DeepL API key, and any other org-wide setting (e.g. toggle auto-translate features). This page will use a simple form. The DeepL API key field will be handled carefully (e.g. masked when viewing, and validated on input).

-   **UI/UX Features:** Filament v3 provides a slick and modern UI with Tailwind CSS and interactive components via Livewire. We will use features like:

    -   **Search and Filters:** The index tables for keys and projects will have search enabled (e.g. search by key name or text). We will also add filters, like a filter for “Untranslated in [Language]” which uses a custom query to find keys where Translation for that language is missing or empty.
    -   **Pagination and Batch Actions:** The keys list will be paginated server-side to handle thousands of records efficiently. We can implement batch actions such as selecting multiple keys and triggering a “Machine translate” action. Filament supports custom bulk actions on lists; clicking this could dispatch a queue job to translate the selected keys via DeepL.
    -   **Modal Forms and Confirmation:** Filament v3 introduced global action modals ([Filament - Accelerated Laravel development framework: admin panel, form builder, table builder and more](https://filamentphp.com/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Hand%20pointing)). We can use modals for confirming destructive actions (like deleting a project or key). Also, certain quick actions (like adding a new translation directly) might use a modal for input.
    -   **Dashboard/Statistics:** Optionally, we can create a dashboard showing stats (number of keys, number of untranslated strings, etc.). Filament makes it easy to build custom dashboard widgets. This can help users quickly see project progress.

-   **Polish and Customization:** Filament is highly customizable – we can adapt the theme (colors, typography) to match the organization's branding if needed ([Filament - Accelerated Laravel development framework: admin panel, form builder, table builder and more](https://filamentphp.com/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Color%20palette)). We will ensure the UI is intuitive: for example, use clear labels, group related fields (Filament’s forms layout can group fields or use tabs if a form is long). For translating content, a common pattern is to list all keys and allow in-place editing of each translation cell; we might implement a simplified version by having an “Edit” button on each key row that opens the multi-language edit form.

-   **Performance in UI:** Even though Filament handles data efficiently (with pagination and lazy loading), for extremely large projects we might implement some additional strategies. For instance, we could require the user to filter by language or section before showing thousands of keys at once, to reduce initial load. We will also utilize Eager Loading in the Resource queries to avoid N+1 issues when showing related data in tables. Filament allows customizing the query in the Resource; e.g., `TranslationKeyResource::indexQuery` can add `with('translations')` so that listing keys doesn’t run a separate query per key for its translations.

Overall, Filament will allow us to deliver a **user-friendly and responsive admin panel** with minimal effort writing front-end code. Translations management can largely reuse Filament’s components (tables, forms, relations), accelerating development. Additionally, Filament v3’s multi-panel capability ([Filament - Accelerated Laravel development framework: admin panel, form builder, table builder and more](https://filamentphp.com/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Multiple%20panels)) means that if in the future we wanted a separate translator-facing panel (with limited permissions) and an admin panel, we could configure that within one Laravel app.

## **6. API Design and Sanctum Authentication**

In parallel to the web UI, the system exposes a **RESTful API** to allow programmatic access and integration (e.g. a JavaScript-based CLI tool for developers to push/pull translations). The API design follows REST principles and uses Laravel’s routing, controllers, and Sanctum for auth:

-   **Routing Structure:** All API endpoints are namespaced under `/api/v1/` (versioning the API allows future changes without breaking clients). We will define routes using Laravel’s API routes (in `routes/api.php`). Example endpoints:

    -   `GET /api/v1/projects` – List all projects the user has access to.
    -   `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}` – Get project details (including languages, etc).
    -   `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/keys` – List translation keys in the project (possibly with query params to filter by untranslated, etc).
    -   `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/translations/{locale}` – Get all translations for project in a given language (this could return a JSON file content, similar to export).
    -   `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/keys` – Create a new translation key.
    -   `PUT /api/v1/keys/{id}/translate` – Update or add translations for a key (client sends locale and text, or multiple locales and texts).
    -   `POST /api/v1/import` – Upload a file (JSON/CSV/Excel) to import – this might actually just enqueue a job and respond with a job ID or status.
    -   `GET /api/v1/export?project={id}&format=csv&locale=...` – Trigger or fetch an export. This could either return the file directly if quick or initiate a background job and provide a way to download later.
    -   `GET /api/v1/languages` – List available languages (for reference).

    These endpoints will be implemented in controllers such as `ProjectController`, `KeyController`, etc. Laravel’s `apiResource` can generate standard CRUD routes for some of these. We will tailor them as needed, including custom routes for import/export actions.

-   **Sanctum for Auth:** Laravel Sanctum is used to secure these routes. Sanctum allows issuing long-lived **personal access tokens** for users ([Laravel Sanctum - Laravel 12.x - The PHP Framework For Web Artisans](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/sanctum#:~:text=Issuing%20API%20Tokens)). A user (via the Filament UI) can create a personal access token (e.g. for CLI usage) which will be shown once and stored hashed in the database. The CLI or any script can then include this token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header of API requests. Sanctum will validate the token and set the authenticated user context. We will use Sanctum’s middleware in `api.php` routes (Sanctum can check both cookies for SPA or tokens for API – in our case, it will primarily see tokens since CLI is not a browser SPA) ([Laravel Sanctum - Laravel 12.x - The PHP Framework For Web Artisans](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/sanctum#:~:text=Sanctum%20will%20only%20attempt%20to,for%20a%20valid%20API%20token)). With Sanctum, we avoid the complexity of OAuth (Passport) while still having secure token auth. We will enforce that API tokens have appropriate scopes if we define any (e.g. a token could be read-only – this would be implemented by assigning an ability like `read` to the token and checking in the relevant policy or middleware). By default, though, any valid token will allow full API access as that user.

-   **Secure Route Access:** By default, Sanctum tokens are tied to a user account, so our policies still apply (e.g. a token issued to a translator won’t allow hitting an admin-only endpoint – the controller’s policy check will deny it). We’ll use middleware like `auth:sanctum` on all API routes to ensure only authenticated requests get through. Additionally, for extra security, we can use rate limiting on the API routes to prevent abuse – Laravel allows defining rate limiters, for instance limiting to 60 requests per minute per token or IP. This may be useful especially for expensive endpoints like export.

-   **API Responses:** All responses will be JSON (with appropriate HTTP status codes). On success, controllers return either a Resource or a collection of Resources. On validation errors, Laravel will return a 422 with error details. We will document the API (perhaps using OpenAPI/Swagger or at least a written doc) so that internal developers know how to use it. Since performance is a concern at scale, endpoints like “get all translations for a project” might paginate or require a filter (to avoid sending megabytes of data in one response). However, for a CLI use-case, it is common to fetch all translations of a project (to generate local files). We will implement that endpoint but ensure it’s efficient (possibly streaming the response or requiring the client to accept chunked responses). We might also encourage clients to use the export feature (which could generate a file) for very large data sets, rather than pulling massive JSON payloads in one go.

-   **CLI Integration Example:** We anticipate a JavaScript-based CLI tool that developers can run (for example, `tms-cli pull fr` to download French translations). This CLI would be configured with the base URL of the self-hosted system and a personal access token. When it runs `pull fr`, it would call our `/api/v1/projects/:id/translations/fr` endpoint to retrieve a JSON (or perhaps it could call an export endpoint to get a JSON file). Similarly, `tms-cli push` could take a local file of keys and hit `/api/v1/import` or iterate through `/api/v1/keys` endpoints to create/update. The API is designed to be comprehensive enough that anything doable in the UI is doable via API as well ([Blog Eleven Labs - Managing translations with localise.biz](https://blog.eleven-labs.com/en/manage-translations-with-localise-biz/#:~:text=REST%20API)) (Loco’s API was a primary reason users choose it, as it allows manipulating all data programmatically ([Blog Eleven Labs - Managing translations with localise.biz](https://blog.eleven-labs.com/en/manage-translations-with-localise-biz/#:~:text=The%20main%20reason%20to%20choose,only%20the%20retrieval%20of%20translations))). Our API will allow full create/read/update of projects, keys, and translations.

-   **Versioning & Evolution:** By prefixing with `v1`, we leave room to introduce a `v2` later if we make breaking changes (like changing the format of the export). For now, JSON is the main format, but in future, we might also allow direct file download via API (e.g. hitting an endpoint could return a CSV file if Accept header is CSV – this can be handled via content negotiation or separate endpoints).

In summary, the API provides a **secure and streamlined way to integrate** with the TMS. Sanctum personal tokens ensure that only authorized users/scripts access the data, and using standard JSON over REST makes it easy to use with any programming language. By structuring the routes logically and using Laravel resources, we ensure consistency between what the UI shows and what the API provides.

## **7. DeepL Integration (Machine Translation Service)**

Integrating DeepL's translation API allows us to auto-translate keys to accelerate the localization process. The architecture for DeepL integration focuses on flexibility (per-organization configuration) and reliability (handling rate limits, errors, retries):

-   **Organization-wide DeepL Config:** The DeepL API credentials (e.g. API key) are stored at the Organization level (each installation has its own key). We’ll store this in the database (Organizations table) in an encrypted field for security. Laravel’s Eloquent has an `$casts` option for `encrypted:` which we can use for this field, so it’s automatically encrypted at rest. In the Filament settings UI, the admin will input the key. We may also allow storing preferences like “Auto-translate new keys by default” or setting a limit to avoid over-use. On application boot, we can load the key into a config value or a service container binding for easy access by the translation service.

-   **Translation Service Class:** We create a service (e.g. `DeepLTranslatorService`) responsible for calling DeepL’s API. This will likely use Laravel’s HTTP client (which wraps Guzzle) to make requests to DeepL’s endpoints. We can use the official DeepL PHP SDK if available ([deeplcom/deepl-php - Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/deeplcom/deepl-php#:~:text=deeplcom%2Fdeepl,quality)), or a lightweight approach with direct HTTP calls. This service class will have methods like `translateText($text, $targetLang, $sourceLang = null)` which returns the translated text or throws an exception on failure. It will inject the organization’s API key (perhaps via the constructor or method parameters – we can determine the current org context easily since this is single-tenant). For efficiency, if a bulk translation endpoint is available, we could also implement a method to translate multiple strings in one API call.

-   **Usage of Queues for Auto-Translation:** Translating via DeepL is a perfect candidate for background jobs. The user might initiate an auto-translate for a batch of keys (via a UI action or an API call). Instead of calling DeepL synchronously and making the user wait, we will create a **job** like `AutoTranslateJob` that handles it. This job will take parameters such as project, source language, target language(s), and maybe a list of key IDs to translate. The job will fetch the text of each key in the source language (likely the project’s primary language) and then call the DeepL service for each or in bulk. As it gets translations back, it will save them as new Translation records (marking `is_machine_translated=true`). Upon completion, we can notify the user (maybe through a UI alert or an email if configured) that auto-translation is done.

-   **Rate Limiting & Quota Management:** DeepL’s API (Free tier) has a monthly character quota (e.g. 500k chars/month) and possibly rate limits on requests ([DeepL API Free vs. DeepL API Pro - DeepL Help Center](https://support.deepl.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021183620-DeepL-API-Free-vs-DeepL-API-Pro#:~:text=DeepL%20API%20Free%20vs,plan%20offers%20the%20following)). To avoid hitting these limits unexpectedly, we incorporate checks:

    -   The system can track how many characters have been translated via DeepL in the current period. DeepL’s API provides an endpoint to retrieve usage ([Retrieve usage & quota - DeepL API Documentation](https://developers.deepl.com/docs/api-reference/usage-and-quota#:~:text=Retrieve%20usage%20%26%20quota%20,together%20with%20the%20corresponding)); our integration could call this periodically or before a large batch. We might store the last known usage in cache to avoid calling too frequently.
    -   If a requested translation batch would exceed the quota or if we detect we’re at risk of hitting it, we can either refuse and inform the user or split the batch (translate until just under the limit).
    -   We also use Laravel’s **Rate Limiter** or simple delays to throttle requests to avoid hitting per-second limits. For example, if DeepL allows say 5 requests per second, our job might use `usleep` or queue throttling to ensure we don’t send too many requests in a short burst.
    -   We can leverage Laravel’s `Http::retry()` method to automatically retry failed requests to DeepL a few times with delays ([HTTP Client - Laravel 11.x - The PHP Framework For Web Artisans](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/http-client#:~:text=Retries)) ([HTTP Client - Laravel 11.x - The PHP Framework For Web Artisans](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/http-client#:~:text=returned%20after%20all%20retries%20have,been%20attempted)). For instance, network issues or transient DeepL errors can be handled by retrying 2-3 times with exponential backoff. If a DeepL call ultimately fails (e.g. due to quota exceeded), the job should catch that and mark the task as failed gracefully (e.g. update a status that can be shown to the user).

-   **Error Handling and Resilience:** Any exceptions during the DeepL API calls (HTTP timeouts, errors) should not crash the whole app. In queued jobs, if an exception is thrown and not caught, Laravel will mark the job as failed and can retry depending on our job settings. We can configure the job with `maxAttempts` and `backoff` (exponential backoff for retries). For example, `AutoTranslateJob` might be allowed 3 attempts with a 30-second backoff. If DeepL is temporarily unavailable, this gives it a chance to recover. We will also catch specific errors (like if a particular text cannot be translated or a language code is unsupported) and handle those (e.g. skip that key with a warning). All failures will be logged for review.

-   **DeepL API Usage Efficiency:** To minimize API calls, if some translations have already been done or if some keys have identical text, we can implement caching of translations. For instance, if the same phrase appears multiple times, we should ideally translate it once and reuse it. We could maintain a simple cache (in memory or database table) of “source text + target language -> translated text” from DeepL. This acts like a Translation Memory. Before calling DeepL, the service can check this cache. If a hit is found, use that result directly; if not, call the API and then store the result. This can save costs and time especially if many keys share common phrases like “OK”, “Cancel”, etc.

-   **Integration Testing:** We will test the integration with a small sample: using a valid DeepL key in a dev environment to ensure the API calls succeed and our code correctly saves the translations. We will also simulate hitting limits by using the usage endpoint (perhaps temporarily lower the threshold in a config for testing) to ensure our logic to stop or warn works.

By encapsulating all of this in a dedicated service and jobs, the DeepL integration remains **cleanly separated** from the rest of the app. In the future, if we add another provider (say Google Translate), we could create a similar service for it. The system could even allow choosing the provider. But for now, DeepL will be integrated as described, giving the organization a powerful tool to fill in translations automatically.

Administrators can thus configure their API key and decide when to use auto-translate. Translators can then review machine translations in the Filament UI and modify as needed (since machine translations will be marked, the UI can highlight them for review).

## **8. Background Jobs and Queue Processing**

Background processing is central to the system’s ability to handle large tasks without degrading UX. Laravel’s queue mechanism will be used extensively, following best practices for job design and queue management:

-   **Queue Driver:** We will configure the queue to use Redis (in production) for high throughput. Redis is in-memory and supports many simultaneous jobs, which is ideal for heavy tasks ([Techniques for Scaling Laravel Applications for High Traffic | by Kamruzzaman Kamrul | Medium](https://medium.com/@kamruljpi/techniques-for-scaling-laravel-applications-for-high-traffic-d1b2394fb865#:~:text=b)) ([Techniques for Scaling Laravel Applications for High Traffic | by Kamruzzaman Kamrul | Medium](https://medium.com/@kamruljpi/techniques-for-scaling-laravel-applications-for-high-traffic-d1b2394fb865#:~:text=Install%20a%20queue%20driver%20like,Redis)). (In smaller installations, one could fall back to the database queue driver, but at scale Redis is preferred.) In `.env`, `QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis` is set, and we ensure a Redis service is available. If Redis is not an option, SQS or other drivers could be used similarly.

-   **Types of Jobs:** We’ll create specific Job classes for tasks such as:

    -   `ImportTranslationsJob` – handles parsing an uploaded file (JSON/CSV/Excel) and writing the data to DB.
    -   `ExportTranslationsJob` – generates a file (or JSON response) for a given project’s translations.
    -   `AutoTranslateJob` (DeepL integration, discussed above).
    -   Possibly `SendInviteEmailJob` if we email invitations to new users (not a core feature but could be included).
    -   `SyncToDiskJob` – if we decide to automatically write translation files to disk or cloud storage after changes (some setups might want files).

    Each job will be queued with relevant data (e.g. project ID, or file path of uploaded file, etc.) and perform its logic in the background. For large data, jobs can be **batched or chained**. Laravel allows job **batching** (multiple jobs dispatched together with a unified progress) – we could use this if, say, an import file is extremely large; we split it into chunks and dispatch a batch of `ImportTranslationsJob` each handling a chunk, with a completion callback when all are done.

-   **Queue Workers & Scaling:** We will run one or more queue worker processes to process jobs from the queue. Using Supervisor on the server, we ensure workers are always running. For example, 2 workers for general jobs and maybe a separate worker for very long jobs if needed (we can use separate queues). Laravel Horizon can be used to manage this – with Horizon, we can define multiple queues (e.g. a “default” queue for quick jobs and a “long” queue for big import/export jobs) and assign workers. Horizon also gives a dashboard to monitor jobs in real-time, which is useful in a TMS to see if a bulk import is still running, etc.

-   **Clean Implementation in Code:** In Laravel, jobs are simple classes that implement the `Handle` method. Ours will typically be placed in `app/Jobs/`. We will make use of Laravel’s queue features like:

    -   **Automatic retry:** If a job fails (throws exception), Laravel can retry it based on properties we set (`public $tries`, `public $backoff` on the job class). For example, if a file import fails due to a DB timeout, a retry might succeed on a less loaded attempt.
    -   **Timeouts:** We will set a `timeout` on jobs to avoid them getting stuck (for instance, a DeepL job shouldn’t run more than a few minutes; an import job might have a longer timeout if processing tens of thousands of entries).
    -   **Progress Feedback:** While not built-in to basic Job, we can use events or cache to communicate progress. For instance, an Import job processing 10,000 entries could periodically update a cache key like "import*progress*[jobId]" with percentages. The UI (Filament) could poll an endpoint to get this progress and display a progress bar. This would make large operations more user-friendly.

-   **Import/Export Implementation via Jobs:**

    -   _Import:_ When an admin uploads a file (through the UI or API), we will store the file (temporarily in storage, e.g. storage/app) and then dispatch an `ImportTranslationsJob` with the path and the chosen project and format. The job will stream-read the file (to handle large files with low memory usage) – for CSV/Excel we’ll use a library (like **Laravel Excel** which can read in chunks and even queue the chunk processing itself ([Supercharged Excel exports and imports in Laravel - GitHub](https://github.com/SpartnerNL/Laravel-Excel#:~:text=Supercharged%20Excel%20exports%20and%20imports,to%20have%20a%20custom))). For JSON, we can stream decode it if it’s huge. Each record (translation entry) will be processed: find or create the corresponding TranslationKey in the project, and insert or update the Translation for each language found. To speed this up, the job may accumulate batches and do bulk inserts (using Eloquent upserts or raw queries) to reduce round-trips. The job will also clear relevant caches (so new translations show up immediately). If the import is extremely large (millions of entries), we could split it by languages or by chunks as mentioned using job batching (Laravel Excel package actually has built-in support to queue chunked imports ([Queued | Laravel Excel](https://docs.laravel-excel.com/3.1/exports/queued.html#:~:text=The%20queue,the%20end%20of%20the%20queue)) ([Supercharged Excel exports and imports in Laravel - GitHub](https://github.com/SpartnerNL/Laravel-Excel#:~:text=Have%20large%20files%3F%20You%20can,to%20have%20a%20custom))).
    -   _Export:_ Similar concept: the user triggers an export (chooses project and format). We dispatch an `ExportTranslationsJob` with those details. The job queries the needed data – e.g. fetch all translations for the project (possibly in chunks to avoid loading entire table at once if very large). It then writes to a file: for CSV/Excel, use Laravel Excel to create an export (which handles memory efficiently); for JSON, we can build an associative array of `key => {lang1: text, lang2: text, ...}` or perhaps an array of records and then json_encode to a file. Once done, the job can either email the file to the user or place it in storage for download. For example, the job could save the file to `storage/exports/project_5_en.csv`. We can then provide a secure URL or a way in the UI to download it. Alternatively, the API could respond with the file content if the job is done immediately. But typically, big exports should be asynchronous. We will likely notify the user (maybe through a session flash or email) “Your export is ready for download.” Filament can show a notification when the user returns, or we keep a section of the UI listing recent export files.

-   **Scheduling:** Though not explicitly requested, we might consider using Laravel’s Task Scheduling (cron via `schedule:run`) for maintenance tasks. For example, clearing out old job records, or automatically triggering periodic exports (as in the Eleven Labs blog, they set up a cron to export and upload to cloud storage ([Blog Eleven Labs - Managing translations with localise.biz](https://blog.eleven-labs.com/en/manage-translations-with-localise-biz/#:~:text=Thus%2C%20we%20export%20the%20contents,that%20takes%20care%20of%20that)) ([Blog Eleven Labs - Managing translations with localise.biz](https://blog.eleven-labs.com/en/manage-translations-with-localise-biz/#:~:text=headers%3A%20))). If needed, we could schedule nightly exports or periodic sync with an app repository.

Using queues ensures the app stays **responsive** – users can queue heavy tasks and continue working on other things while they run. This design leverages Laravel’s strength in queue handling, where “queues offload time-consuming tasks, allowing your app to respond faster” ([Techniques for Scaling Laravel Applications for High Traffic | by Kamruzzaman Kamrul | Medium](https://medium.com/@kamruljpi/techniques-for-scaling-laravel-applications-for-high-traffic-d1b2394fb865#:~:text=2)) ([Techniques for Scaling Laravel Applications for High Traffic | by Kamruzzaman Kamrul | Medium](https://medium.com/@kamruljpi/techniques-for-scaling-laravel-applications-for-high-traffic-d1b2394fb865#:~:text=3)). Moreover, it sets the stage for **scaling**: if translation volume grows, we can simply increase the number of workers or move queue processing to separate servers, without changing code. The separation of concerns (controller dispatches a job and immediately returns control) means our web servers are free to handle more requests rather than being tied up in translation processing.

## **9. Performance and Scalability Considerations**

To meet the requirement of managing as many keys as a large SaaS TMS, every layer of the stack is tuned for performance:

-   **Database Performance:** Proper indexing is the first line of defense. We will add indexes on all foreign keys and any column used in lookups (e.g. `TranslationKey.key`). Indexing “significantly improves query performance by reducing the time to fetch records” ([Techniques for Scaling Laravel Applications for High Traffic | by Kamruzzaman Kamrul | Medium](https://medium.com/@kamruljpi/techniques-for-scaling-laravel-applications-for-high-traffic-d1b2394fb865#:~:text=a)). We will also consider the size of data types (using INT for IDs, varchars of appropriate length for codes, etc.) to keep the index small. For extremely large tables (say millions of translations), partitioning could be an option (e.g. partition Translation by project_id), but this adds complexity and is usually not needed unless we reach tens of millions of rows. Our single-tenant scope (one org’s data) means we are not forced to partition by tenant, which simplifies things.

-   **Query Optimization:** We will avoid N+1 queries via Eloquent eager loading ([Techniques for Scaling Laravel Applications for High Traffic | by Kamruzzaman Kamrul | Medium](https://medium.com/@kamruljpi/techniques-for-scaling-laravel-applications-for-high-traffic-d1b2394fb865#:~:text=b)) as described. When retrieving translations, we might sometimes use raw queries or the query builder for complex reporting to ensure efficiency. For example, to find all untranslated keys for a language, instead of loading all keys and filtering in PHP, we’d do a SQL query that left-joins translations and filters where `translation.text IS NULL`. This leverages the database for heavy lifting. We will also use appropriate **pagination** for any list views (both UI and API) to avoid loading too much at once.

-   **Caching Strategies:** As mentioned, we utilize caching aggressively but intelligently. Aside from application-level caching, database query caching (if using MySQL, the query cache, or using Redis to cache query results manually) can help with repeated expensive queries. For instance, if the same export endpoint is hit repeatedly without changes in between, caching that result in Redis and serving it until invalidation is an option. Also, we may use Laravel’s model caching packages if needed, but manual caching per use-case is often clearer.

-   **Memory Management:** Dealing with large data (like reading a 100k-line CSV) can consume a lot of PHP memory if done naively. We mitigate this by **streaming** data and processing in chunks. Libraries like Laravel Excel are built for this: they can process large files by reading/writing one chunk at a time so memory usage stays constant. When generating exports, we will avoid loading an entire huge dataset into an array; instead, fetch a chunk (maybe 1000 rows), write to file, then fetch next (this can be done with cursors or chunked queries in Laravel). Similarly, when importing, using chunk reading prevents memory exhaustion.

-   **Concurrent Access and Transactions:** In a multi-user scenario (several translators working at once), we expect minimal conflicts (since typically each person works on different keys or languages). However, we will use database transactions for operations that involve multiple steps, to maintain consistency (e.g., creating a new project and its default languages and some initial keys – wrap in a transaction). Deadlocks are unlikely but if we do heavy parallel imports, we should catch database exceptions and retry if necessary. Laravel’s queue jobs can be configured to retry on deadlocks as well.

-   **Scaling Up:** The application can scale vertically (on a more powerful server) or horizontally. As it’s a stateful app (with a single DB), scaling horizontally would involve running multiple instances of the app behind a load balancer, all connecting to the same database and Redis. This is feasible because Laravel is stateless between requests (especially using Sanctum tokens rather than sessions for API). We just need to make sure file storage (for import/export files) is shared or use a service like S3 for that. The queue workers can also be scaled horizontally (multiple servers pulling from the same Redis queue). This design can thus handle high throughput: for example, if a user triggers 10 export jobs simultaneously, multiple workers can handle them in parallel. Also, operations that are read-heavy (like an app frequently requesting translations) can be scaled by adding a caching layer or even a read-replica database if needed.

-   **Laravel Octane (Optional):** If extremely high request throughput is needed (e.g. thousands of API requests per second asking for translations), we could consider running Laravel Octane with RoadRunner or Swoole to boost performance. Octane keeps the application in memory between requests, which would benefit repeated requests to load translations (cache warm). This is an advanced optimization that might not be necessary initially, but it’s an option if we need to serve a very high volume of API traffic.

-   **Testing and Profiling:** We will use tools to profile the application under load. For example, using Laravel Telescope or Clockwork in dev to identify slow queries or memory hogs, and JMeter or Locust for load testing the API. This will help ensure that, for instance, an export of 100k keys completes in a reasonable time and doesn’t time out. We’ll also test the UI with large data (making sure the Filament UI still responds quickly when tables have many pages of entries – likely fine with pagination and indexing).

-   **Example of Scale:** Imagine a project with 50,000 keys and 10 languages (thus 500k translations). Our system should handle this. The database size might be on the order of tens of MBs for text, which MySQL/Postgres can manage with ease. Queries for one language’s translations (50k rows) will use indexes to be efficient. We might employ some sharding (like splitting extremely large projects into multiple in the UI) if needed, but ideally the design handles it straightforwardly. The key is that all heavy operations are async (so UI never tries to load all 500k at once) and the DB queries are optimized and cacheable.

By incorporating these considerations, we ensure the TMS is **highly performant**. Many strategies are standard scaling techniques for Laravel apps: caching what we can (routes, data) ([Tips regarding improving the performance of a Laravel application](https://www.reddit.com/r/laravel/comments/sdvt0p/tips_regarding_improving_the_performance_of_a/#:~:text=Tips%20regarding%20improving%20the%20performance,relationships%20if%20you%20can%2C)), eager loading relationships, using queues, and optimizing the database. As one source notes, “Cache what you can, paginate what you can, reduce queries via joins/preloading” ([Tips regarding improving the performance of a Laravel application](https://www.reddit.com/r/laravel/comments/sdvt0p/tips_regarding_improving_the_performance_of_a/#:~:text=Tips%20regarding%20improving%20the%20performance,relationships%20if%20you%20can%2C)) – our plan follows that advice. In essence, we aim for the system to feel snappy for end-users and to gracefully handle heavy lifting in the background without sacrificing data integrity or consistency.

## **10. Import/Export Functionality**

Robust import and export of translations are crucial features for a TMS (for migrating data and integrating with developer workflows). Here’s how we plan to implement them:

-   **Supported Formats:** We will support JSON, CSV, and Excel (XLSX) as specified. This covers common use cases:

    -   **JSON:** Likely structure is one JSON file per language (as Loco does: “one file per language” ([Blog Eleven Labs - Managing translations with localise.biz](https://blog.eleven-labs.com/en/manage-translations-with-localise-biz/#:~:text=Thus%2C%20we%20export%20the%20contents,that%20takes%20care%20of%20that))), containing key-value pairs. For example, an English export might be `{ "homepage.welcome": "Welcome", "errors.404": "Page not found", ... }`. Alternatively, we could output a single JSON with a nested structure of languages, but that can be cumbersome; it’s more typical to have one file per locale. We will follow the one-file-per-language approach for easier use in applications (and it mirrors how many frameworks store locale files).
    -   **CSV:** CSV can combine multiple languages or be one per language. We will implement the commonly requested format: a CSV with columns: Key, Language, Translation (or with a column for each language). However, having each language in a separate column makes one file contain all languages, which might be easier to review in Excel. Another approach is a CSV per language (two columns: Key, Translation). We can actually do both depending on user choice. For simplicity, we might generate a multi-column CSV: first column is the key, then one column per selected language. This is similar to how some managers export to Excel. In CSV format, if not all languages are needed, user can export a subset.
    -   **Excel:** Excel format will likely mirror the multi-language CSV (but in .xlsx). We can create a sheet with columns for each language, or separate sheets for each language. The easier approach is one sheet: Column A = Key, Column B = English, Column C = French, etc. This is convenient for translators who want to fill in an Excel file offline. We will use a library (Maatwebsite Laravel Excel) which makes creating such spreadsheets straightforward (by providing an array of rows or using its fluent Excel export builder). Laravel Excel also supports queueable exports, which we will leverage for large datasets (it can automatically chunk data and use multiple jobs if needed) ([Supercharged Excel exports and imports in Laravel - GitHub](https://github.com/SpartnerNL/Laravel-Excel#:~:text=Supercharged%20Excel%20exports%20and%20imports,to%20have%20a%20custom)).

-   **Import Process:** The import logic will parse files of the above formats:

    -   For a JSON import, we determine if it’s a single-language file (if the keys at root are translations) or a combined file. Likely we’ll support single-language JSON import. The user should specify which language the file is for (or infer from file name or contents). We then iterate through the JSON keys: for each key, find or create the TranslationKey, then set the Translation for that language. If the key doesn’t exist, we create a new key (with perhaps a default translation in primary language if the imported language is primary or leave others blank).
    -   For a CSV import, if it’s multi-language (columns), we can iterate each row: the first column gives the key. Then for each language column that is present, we save the translation. If a particular cell is empty, we skip (no change). If it’s a two-column CSV (key, translation), then it must be imported for a specific language (provided by user UI selection).
    -   For Excel, similarly, read each row, handle multiple columns. Laravel Excel can give us each row as an array.

    We will incorporate validation and error handling – e.g., if a row is badly formatted, we might log it and skip, or if a key is missing. If many errors, we could compile them and present to the user after import.

    Because imports can be huge, this is done in a queued job (as described in the Queue section). For feedback, we may show a summary: “1000 keys imported/updated, 5 errors.” Possibly provide a downloadable error log.

-   **Export Process:** The user (or API client) selects a project and one or more languages to export (or all). The system generates the files as described:

    -   JSON: We’ll produce a zip if multiple languages (e.g. en.json, fr.json inside a zip). If one language, directly that JSON file. Loco’s example shows exporting to JSON and then their script uploading to cloud storage ([Blog Eleven Labs - Managing translations with localise.biz](https://blog.eleven-labs.com/en/manage-translations-with-localise-biz/#:~:text=headers%3A%20)) – our system can simply let the user download it directly.
    -   CSV: If multiple languages, likely one CSV with multiple columns.
    -   Excel: One Excel with all requested languages as columns.

    After generation (which is done in a job if large), the file will be available for download. Through the Filament admin, we might implement a “Export Center” where completed export files are listed (with a link and date). Files can be stored in `storage/app/exports/` and served via a temporary signed URL (Laravel can generate a signed route to download, ensuring only authorized access). We’ll also ensure to clean up old export files periodically to save space (perhaps a scheduler to delete files older than X days).

-   **Integration with API/CLI:** The API can expose exports in two ways:

    1. A synchronous request: e.g. `GET /api/projects/1/translations/en` returns JSON directly (assuming manageable size). This is good for quick pulls of one language.
    2. An asynchronous approach: `POST /api/export?project=1&format=excel&languages[]=en&languages[]=fr` could trigger an export job and return a job ID or tracking token. The client could then poll an endpoint `/api/export-status/{id}` and once ready, get a download URL. This is more complex to implement; given single-tenant nature, it might be acceptable to do synchronous for reasonable sizes. We’ll likely implement the simpler approach first (synchronous for JSON of a single language or small sets, which covers most CLI needs like pulling one locale’s latest data). For very large exports via API, we’ll document that the user should use the UI or possibly break it by language.

-   **Filters and Options:** We may allow filtering on export (like only export “translated keys” or only keys with certain tags). This is something Loco supports ([Blog Eleven Labs - Managing translations with localise.biz](https://blog.eleven-labs.com/en/manage-translations-with-localise-biz/#:~:text=Of%20course%2C%20when%20migrating%20to,all%20the%20details%20if%20needed)). In our initial version, we might export all keys for the project by default, or possibly give an option “exclude untranslated keys” if that’s useful (though usually one wants placeholders for untranslated as empty or with fallback). We will include the fallback substitution logic during export so that no empty strings are in the output unless explicitly desired.

By implementing import/export thoroughly, we ensure that organizations can easily onboard (import existing translations from a legacy system via CSV/Excel) and offboard or integrate (export to use in applications or send to translation vendors). The use of background jobs, as mentioned, guarantees that even a **“very complete import/export system with a wide range of formats”** ([Blog Eleven Labs - Managing translations with localise.biz](https://blog.eleven-labs.com/en/manage-translations-with-localise-biz/#:~:text=Of%20course%2C%20when%20migrating%20to,all%20the%20details%20if%20needed)) does not hinder the app’s performance. Users will appreciate that they can trigger these operations and not have the app time out on them.

## **11. Conclusion**

In this technical architecture plan, we outlined a comprehensive solution for a Laravel-based Translation Management System that is **scalable, maintainable, and feature-rich**. By leveraging Laravel 12’s robust features – **Eloquent** for relational modeling, **Sanctum** for API authentication, **Queues** for asynchronous processing, and the **service container** for clean code organization – and pairing it with **Filament v3** for a modern admin UI, the system will provide an experience on par with enterprise TMS platforms, yet in a self-hosted, single-tenant setup. Key design choices such as a normalized database schema with indexed access to potentially millions of translations, a layered architecture (controllers → services → repositories) for clarity, and careful integration of external services (DeepL) with rate-limit handling ensure that the application can grow with the organization’s needs.

Crucially, we have baked in **performance optimizations** (caching, chunked processing, eager loading) and **scalability options** so that even as the number of projects or translation keys grows, the system remains responsive. Whether a user is a translator working in the Filament UI or a developer syncing translations via the API/CLI, they will encounter a smooth workflow: translations can be filtered, auto-filled with machine suggestions, imported/exported in bulk – all orchestrated by Laravel in the background.

By following this plan, developers implementing the system should be able to build the TMS in a modular fashion – focusing on one component at a time (e.g. setting up the data model, then the UI, then the API, etc.), with confidence that these components will integrate into a cohesive whole. The end result will be a **polished application** that centralizes translation management, accelerates localization through automation (DeepL), and maintains the high standards of reliability and security expected in 2025 and beyond.
