-   [ ] Set up Laravel Horizon (queue dashboard)
-   [ ] Implement progress tracking for long-running jobs

## Phase 4: DeepL Integration

-   [ ] Create DeepL service class
-   [x] Implement secure API key storage
-   [ ] Add DeepL API communication
-   [ ] Add rate limiting and quota management
-   [ ] Create fallback mechanisms for API issues

## Phase 5: Import/Export System

-   [x] Implement file format handlers:
    -   [x] JSON export/import
    -   [x] CSV export/import
    -   [ ] Excel export/import
-   [x] Create export file storage and download system
-   [x] Add UI for import/export operations
-   [x] Implement error handling and reporting

## Phase 6: API Development

-   [x] Configure Sanctum for authentication
-   [x] Create API controllers:
    -   [x] ProjectController
    -   [x] TranslationKeyController
    -   [x] TranslationController
    -   [x] ExportController
    -   [ ] ImportController
-   [x] Implement API Resources for data transformation
-   [x] Add validation, error handling, and rate limiting

## Phase 7: Performance Optimization

-   [x] Add database indexing for performance
-   [x] Implement caching strategies
-   [x] Optimize queries with eager loading
-   [ ] Test with large datasets
